Problem Statement: Predict Customer Churn in
at Camtel
Scenario:
You are tasked with building a machine learning model to
predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service)
in the next month at Camtel. The dataset includes
customer behavior data such as usage patterns, customer
support interaction, billing information, and demographic
details. However, you’ve noticed that over time, customer
behavior is changing due to new service offerings, pricing
models, and market competition, leading to both concept
drift and data shifts.
Dataset:
● Historical customer data for the past 3 years. It
includes:
○ Customer demographic information (age, region,
income, etc.).
○ Service usage data (monthly minutes, data
usage, etc.).
○ Interaction data with customer service (number of
support tickets, response times).
○ Billing information (monthly bills, outstanding
balance).○ Target variable: Churn (whether the customer left
the company or stayed).
● The dataset has been partitioned into different time
periods. You’ll notice that patterns of churn behavior
have changed over time due to shifts in customer
preferences and the introduction of new service
offerings.
Challenge:
You need to train a model that can handle:
1. Concept drift: The patterns that lead to customer
churn have shifted over time due to changes in
service quality, market competition, and customer
expectations.
2. Data shifts: The distribution of customers (e.g., age
groups, regions) has shifted due to expansion into
new markets.
Tasks:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
○ Explore the dataset for missing values,
anomalies, and correlations between features.
○ Split the dataset into training and test sets based
on different time periods (e.g., first 2 years for
training, the last year for testing).○ Handle class imbalance (if there are more
non-churners than churners) by applying
techniques such as oversampling,
undersampling, or using performance metrics like
AUC-ROC.
2. Initial Model Training:
○ Train a logistic regression or decision tree
model using the first year’s data. Evaluate its
performance on the following year’s data.
○ Investigate how performance changes over time.
Do you see any signs of concept drift or data
shifts (e.g., model performance deteriorates as
you move to newer data)?
3. Dealing with Concept Drift and Data Shifts:
○ Apply time-weighted learning where more
recent data is weighted higher when training the
model.
○ Use online learning algorithms like stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) to continuously update
the model as new data comes in.
○ Incorporate ensemble models to combine
models trained on different time periods (e.g.,
train one model for each year of data and
ensemble their predictions).
4. Evaluate Model Adaptation:○ Compare the performance of your adapted
models to a baseline model that doesn’t handle
concept drift or data shifts.
○ Measure how the model handles both older and
newer customer data.
5. Drift Detection (Optional but Advanced):
○ Implement a drift detection mechanism to monitor
when concept drift occurs in the model's
predictions (e.g., ADWIN or Page-Hinkley test).
○ Retrain or adapt the model dynamically when drift
is detected.
Metrics to Monitor:
● Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Basic
performance measures.
● AUC-ROC: For imbalanced datasets, this is useful to
measure the trade-off between true positive rate and
false positive rate.
● Model performance over time: Monitor if model
performance declines as you move to more recent
data (sign of concept drift or data shifts).
Outcome:
Your goal is to build a predictive model that not only
performs well on historical data but can also adapt to
future changes in customer behavior, ensuring it remains
accurate over time.DATASET LINK
